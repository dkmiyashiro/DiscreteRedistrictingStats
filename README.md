# DiscreteRedistrictingStats
This repository contains the optional complementary Python notebooks that go along with the Mathematics of Redistricting textbook.

For the runnable notebook, check the 'Coastal vs Non-Coastal Statistics.ipynb' file (the spaces should be removed to avoid any errors). For a more consumable, completed version, check out the 'Coastal vs Non-Coastal Statistics.pdf' instead!
